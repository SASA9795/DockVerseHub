## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### 🎯 Code Standards

#### Dockerfile Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds when appropriate
- Minimize layer count and image size
- Include health checks for services
- Use specific version tags, avoid `latest`
- Add security scanning configurations

```dockerfile
# ✅ Good
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app ./
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Docker Compose Standards

- Use version 3.8 or later
- Include resource limits
- Add health checks
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Include restart policies

```yaml
# ✅ Good example
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV:-development}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.5"
          memory: 512M
```

### 📝 Documentation Standards

#### Markdown Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Include code examples for all concepts
- Add command outputs where helpful
- Use consistent formatting
- Include difficulty indicators

#### Content Structure

Each new concept should include:

1. **Overview** - What and why
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need to know
3. **Step-by-step instructions**
4. **Working examples**
5. **Common pitfalls**
6. **Troubleshooting**
7. **Further reading**

### 🧪 Lab Development Guidelines

#### Lab Structure
Each lab should contain:
- `README.md` with clear instructions
- `Dockerfile(s)` with best practices
- `docker-compose.yml` if multi-container
- Source code for applications
- Test scripts for validation

#### Lab Requirements
- **Self-contained**: Can run independently
- **Well-documented**: Clear setup and usage
- **Tested**: Verified working examples
- **Educational**: Teaches specific concepts
- **Progressive**: Builds on previous knowledge

#### Example Lab Structure
