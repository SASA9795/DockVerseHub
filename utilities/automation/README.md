# Docker Automation Tools

This directory contains automation tools and templates for CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies with Docker.

## Contents

### CI/CD Templates

- **gitlab-ci.yml** - GitLab CI pipeline templates

### Deployment Scripts
- **blue-green.sh** - Blue-green deployment automation
- **rolling-update.sh** - Rolling update deployment

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Features
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Security scanning integration
- Automated image tagging
- Registry push/pull
- Deployment automation
- Parallel job execution
- Caching optimization

### GitLab CI Features
- Docker-in-Docker support
- Registry integration
- Multiple environment deployments
- Artifact management
- Pipeline optimization

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
Zero-downtime deployment strategy that maintains two identical production environments.

**Usage:**
```bash
./deployment/blue-green.sh deploy myapp:v2.0
```

**Features:**
- Health check validation
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Load balancer switching
- Database migration support

### Rolling Updates
Gradual replacement of application instances with new versions.

**Usage:**
```bash
./deployment/rolling-update.sh update myapp:v2.0 --replicas 5
```

**Features:**
- Configurable batch sizes
- Health monitoring
- Pause/resume capabilities
- Automatic rollback

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use image scanning in pipelines
- Implement secret management
- Enable vulnerability checks
- Sign container images

### Performance
- Optimize build caching
- Use multi-stage builds
- Implement parallel jobs
- Minimize image layers

### Reliability
- Implement health checks
- Add retry mechanisms
- Monitor deployment metrics
- Plan rollback strategies

## Configuration Examples

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Registry configuration
REGISTRY_URL=registry.example.com
REGISTRY_USERNAME=deployer
REGISTRY_PASSWORD=secret

# Deployment settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
REPLICAS=3
HEALTH_CHECK_URL=/health
```

### Pipeline Triggers
- Push to main branch
- Tag creation
- Pull request updates
- Scheduled builds
- Manual triggers

## Monitoring Integration

### Metrics Collection
- Build duration tracking
- Deployment success rates
- Image size monitoring
- Security scan results

### Alerting
- Failed deployment notifications
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Performance degradation warnings
- Resource usage alerts

## Getting Started

1. **Choose your CI/CD platform**
2. **Copy appropriate template**
3. **Configure environment variables**
4. **Customize for your application**
5. **Test with staging environment**
6. **Deploy to production**
