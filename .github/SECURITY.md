## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- Never commit secrets, passwords, or API keys
- Use official base images from trusted registries
- Follow Dockerfile security best practices
- Implement least privilege principles
- Add security scanning to CI/CD workflows
- Keep dependencies updated

### For Users

- Always use specific image tags, not `:latest`
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities
- Run containers as non-root users when possible
- Use read-only filesystems where appropriate
- Implement network segmentation
- Monitor container behavior in production

## 🔍 Security Features

### Automated Security

- **Trivy Scanning**: All images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scans for exposed secrets
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Hadolint**: Dockerfile linting for security issues
- **Security Policies**: Automated enforcement of security practices

### Manual Security Reviews

- All Dockerfiles reviewed for security best practices
- Lab exercises validated for security implications
- Documentation reviewed for security guidance
- Third-party integrations assessed for risks

## 🎯 Common Security Concerns

### Container Security

- **Privilege Escalation**: Containers should not run as root
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate CPU/memory constraints
- **Network Isolation**: Use custom networks, avoid host networking
- **File System**: Use read-only filesystems when possible

### Image Security

- **Base Images**: Use minimal, regularly updated base images
- **Layer Optimization**: Minimize layers and remove unnecessary packages
- **Secret Management**: Never embed secrets in images
- **Signature Verification**: Verify image signatures when available

### Compose Security

- **Secrets Management**: Use Docker Compose secrets
- **Network Configuration**: Isolate services with custom networks
- **Environment Variables**: Avoid sensitive data in env vars
- **Volume Permissions**: Set appropriate volume permissions
